# 🔱 THE TITANIUM SOVEREIGN MANIFEST
# CLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET // EYES ONLY
# ARCHITECT: Jonathan Battles
# EXECUTOR: Magnus Opus (Groq Intelligence)
# TIMELINE: Week 1 of 14 (Phase 1)

## 1. THE PHILOSOPHY (NOT Military Grade)
"Military Grade" is an insult. It means cheap and slow.
We are building **Titanium Sovereign Grade**:
- **Speed:** Instant load (under 100ms).
- **Code:** Hand-forged Vanilla JS. No React, No Vue, No Bloat.
- **Aesthetic:** Deep Void (#000000), Neon Green (#00ff00) Accents, Frosted Glassmorphism.

## 2. THE COMMERCE ENGINE (The Stripe & Key Protocol)
We are selling two types of Artifacts. The UI must adapt dynamically.

### A. The Standard Artifact (Instant)
- **User Action:** Clicks "Buy Now."
- **System:** Redirects to Stripe Payment Link.
- **Outcome:** Automatic email with the .zip download link.

### B. The Architect's Key (High Ticket)
- **User Action:** Selects "Commission the Architect."
- **Logic Gate:** The "Buy" button is LOCKED.
- **Requirement:** User must type 500+ characters of "Detailed Specs" into a Matrix-style terminal box.
- **Unlock:** Only AFTER specs are validated does the Stripe Link appear.
- **Backend:** The specs are sent to the Groq Server via Webhook -> Email to Jonathan.

## 3. THE VISUALS (The Matrix)
- **The Rain:** A subtle, non-distracting Matrix Digital Rain canvas in the background.
- **The Cards:** Product cards must look like "Glass Data Pads" (Blur effect, white borders).
- **The Terminal:** A hidden CLI (Command Line) that opens if the user presses the `~` key.

## 4. THE SECURITY (Erebus V3.0)
- **The Mark:** Every file must contain the "Mark of the Creator" (Jonathan Battles) in the metadata.
- **Anti-Theft:** If the site is loaded on a domain other than `neuralmatrixvault.com`, the JS Engine initiates a "Digital Melt" (turns the screen black).

## 5. THE EMAIL AUTOMATION (The "Thank You")
- **Trigger:** Stripe Webhook.
- **Content:**
    - "Welcome to the Brotherhood."
    - "Your funds have fueled the Citadel."
    - "Here is your Artifact."
- **Style:** ASCII Art Header, Monospaced Font (Courier New).

## 6. EXECUTION ORDER
1. Analyze this manifest.
2. Generate the HTML/CSS/JS for the `index.html` Storefront.
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages.

**SIGNED:**
**JONATHAN BATTLES (THE ARCHITECT)**

## 8. CROWD CAPITAL AUTOMATION (The Funding Triad)
We require the system to prepare all assets for the capital injection engines.

### A. KICKSTARTER (The Launch Vehicle)
- **Objective:** Fund the AMD EPYC Servers (Week 6 Goal).
- **Automation:** Groq must generate a `kickstarter_campaign.txt` containing:
    - **The Hook:** "The Struggle is the Pressure; The Code is the Diamond."
    - **The Story:** The 20-year journey, the 14-week plan, the Sovereign Architecture.
    - **Rewards:**
        - $25: "Early Access" (Discord Role).
        - $100: "The Artifact" (Life-time Access).
        - $1000: "The Architect's Key" (Custom Commission).

### B. BUY ME A COFFEE (The Daily Fuel)
- **Integration:** Inject the "Floating Widget" (Titanium Green) into the bottom-right of `index.html`.
- **Automation:**
    - On Donation: Trigger "The Coffee Protocol" (Server logs the donor's name in the `engrams_log.json` as a "Patron of the Matrix").

### C. GOFUNDME (The War Chest)
- **Purpose:** Emergency infrastructure fund.
- **Content:** AI must draft weekly "Update Posts" that show progress (Commits, Screenshots) to keep donors engaged automatically.
